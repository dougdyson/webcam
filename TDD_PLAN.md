# Test-Driven Development Plan - Webcam Human Detection

## TDD Philosophy & Process

Following strict **Red → Green → Refactor** methodology:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines the desired functionality
2. **GREEN**: Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing
4. **COMMIT**: After each successful cycle, consider committing changes
